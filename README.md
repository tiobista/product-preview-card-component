## My process

I first start with structure i.e, with the html (HTML5 semantics) then move to the CSS part and finally I went to Css Media query.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned alot about Css Media query Css Flex box especially how the flex direction affect the layout we build.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

Changing image url in Css based on the screen size that is Awsome.

```css
img {
  content: url("images/image-product-mobile.jpg");
  width: 100%;
}
```
